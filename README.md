## Inspiration
In a competitive field like computer science, the issue of imposter syndrome is ever so evident. We want to provide mental support and help to those in need. The Michigan Daily surveyed 400 students with a focus on imposter syndrome and it was found that nearly 40% of students feel that they are less adequate in comparison to other students. Feelings of self-doubt can stir up a lot of fear, anxiety, and stress. Studies have suggested imposter syndrome can lead to a drop in job performance and job satisfaction while increasing burnout. It's also been linked to anxiety and depression. We aim to help relieve such issue so that students can have a challenging yet healthy time at the University of Michigan.
