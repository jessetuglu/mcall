## Inspiration
In a competitive field like computer science, the issue of imposter syndrome is ever so evident. We want to provide mental support and help to those in need. The Michigan Daily surveyed 400 students with a focus on imposter syndrome and it was found that nearly 40% of students feel that they are less adequate in comparison to other students. Feelings of self-doubt can stir up a lot of fear, anxiety, and stress. Studies have suggested imposter syndrome can lead to a drop in job performance and job satisfaction while increasing burnout. It's also been linked to anxiety and depression. We aim to help relieve such issue so that students can have a challenging yet healthy time at the University of Michigan.

## What it does
MCall is an online mental health service that helps people engage with their own feelings and write them down. The website also provides suicide prevention resources, as well as a simple and interactive UI that is friendly to all.

## How we built it
- Frontend: React.js
- Server: Node.js / Express.js
- Twilio Voice and SMS Verfication APIs
- AssemblyAI Speeech-to-Text and Transcription APIs


## Challenges we ran into
- 3D renders failed to cover on canvas
- Some SVGs failed to be converted in javascript files
- Considering different types of auth
- Attempted to use AssemblyAI Speaker Labels, but they were inaccurate, so this forced us to take a more modest approach.
- Faced the inconveniences of the limitations of free trials and free plans on the services we used.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Robust, Persistent Auth Flow
- Nice UI
- Twilio Voice Integration
- Twilio SMS Verification
- AssemblyAI Transcription and Speech-to-text integrations
## What we learned
